# Journal of Living Reviews

Due to the rapid pace of discovery, scientific reviews tend to become out of date during the editorial process before they
 are even published, and it only gets worse from there. Fortunately, there is another option: A version controlled document
 that can be updated with every new discovery the moment it is reported.

Here at JLR we provide you with the tools to author a living review.
